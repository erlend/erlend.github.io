Stylesheets are handled differently based on whether you're in a development or
production environments. The environment can be changed by setting the
environment variable "JEKYLL_ENV" to "development" or "production".

The main difference between the two is that in production the output file is
minified and its MD5 hash is added to the filename for cache-busting.

Use tailwindcss-cli in development for close to instant updates.
